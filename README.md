# Saggat
A Procedual Planetary Sytem Generator written in Qt3D

This is a side project, which will ever be work in progress. Have Fun!

For Height and colors it's using Simplex or Perlin Noise. It uses a GeoSphere and modifies its polygons. The shader calculates it's color based on this mesh and additional also computes a moisture map.

It's a fun project good for nothing.
